## increment Counter: Basic React-Redux Example

This is a modification of the [Intro to Redux Counter Example](https://redux.js.org/introduction/examples#counter)

### Notes on the sample

I did some "challenges" beyond the tutorial example and added a counter display component that just totals the # of clicks. 
Seems to me like this was simular to the React example. I'm still passing down properties from parent to child (Counter to CounterDisplay) as props. Am I missing something with Redux?
