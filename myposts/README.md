### Tutorial Example

How to create a blog post SPA with React-Redux following [Krunal Lathiya's sample](https://appdividend.com/2018/06/14/how-to-connect-react-and-redux-with-example/).

### Notes on Sample

This was a test if I could build an app without relying on the tutorials. Went pretty straight forward. Still sometimes have to make liberal use of ```debugger``` to watch how properties/state/react store is getting modified and passed around.

- Added Jest test framework to test.
